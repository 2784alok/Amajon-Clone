# Amajon-Clone
In my first college semester, I recreated Amazon using HTML and CSS. This project deepened my web development skills, focusing on structure, styling, responsiveness, and user experience. It's the foundation of my web development journey, and I look forward to more complex projects.
 It was a big learning experience for me. I learned how to make web pages and style them to look like Amazon's site. This project taught me a lot about web design and how to make websites work on different devices. It also helped me understand the importance of paying attention to details and problem-solving. This project was the start of my journey into web development, and I'm excited to learn more and do even cooler things in the future.
